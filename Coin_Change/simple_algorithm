input:
- SUM
- COIN denominations

output:
minimum coins to provide that change

constraints:
money<=20000
0<=coins<=7
1<= value of coin <=100



algorithm:

Array(max size 7) -> take coin denominations(b/w 1-100) as input
Int(max size 20000) -> take sum as input

Function(min change)
{
Calculate possibilities
Calc. minimum of possi.
}
